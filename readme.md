# Rate the Raunt

This app originated from a simple observation: my girlfriend and I are passionate about food, yet we had no means of keeping track of our dining experiencesâ€”what we enjoyed and what we didn't.

Rate the Raunt is a CRUD application that leverages the GOOGLE PLACES API to let you add new restaurants. It offers functionality to post reviews, delete restaurant entries, and modify both the reviews and their associated ratings.

```BASH
